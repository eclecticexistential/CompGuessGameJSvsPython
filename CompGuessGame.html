  <p>
	I wanted to compare the differences between writing a program in Python and coding the same program in Javascript.
	The game requires users to enter a number and the computer eliminates possible answers by changing the range of possible numbers.
	In Python, I was able to achieve this in 31 lines of code. *see below
	Javascript, however, required double that before adding in UI tools.
	Try it for yourself!
	Enter a number below to activate the Javascript version.

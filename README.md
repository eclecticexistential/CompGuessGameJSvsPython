# CompGuessGameJSvsPython
##Javascript and Python versions of a Computer Number Guessing Game

I wanted to compare the differences between writing a program in Python and coding the same program in Javascript. 

The game requires users to enter a number and the computer eliminates possible answers by changing the range of possible numbers. 

In Python, I was able to achieve this in 31 lines of code. 

Javascript, however, required double that before adding in UI tools.
